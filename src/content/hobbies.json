      "text": "My primary hobby outside of academic interests is poker. I've mostly played Texas No-Limit cash games at $5/10 stakes, where I've been a strong, winning player. Recently, I transitioned into tournaments. I <b>paid my last semester's tuition entirely</b> with my poker earnings. In addition to poker, I enjoy improving my typing speed. Most of my <i>recent</i> typing tests are done on <u><a href='https://monkeytype.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>monkeytype.com</a></u>, where I average ~160 words per minute. I also very recently started playing chess at the beginning of 2024. I play on <u><a href='https://lichess.org' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>lichess.org</a></u> where I have a rating of 1600+ in bullet and blitz."
